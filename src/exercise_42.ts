// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.


let Magicians: string[] = ["Harry", "John", "Carter", "Flemming"];


function makeGreat(arr: string[]) {
    let madeGreat = arr.map((element: string) => {
        return `Great ${element}`
    })

    return madeGreat

}

let greatMagicians = makeGreat(Magicians)

function showMagicians(arr: string[]) {
    arr.forEach((element: string) => {
        console.log(element);

    })
}

showMagicians(greatMagicians)
